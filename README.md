# SolidWorks-FEA
In solid mechanics, we study how an object undergoes external changes from forces, moments, temperature, and other loads. Using the CAD software SolidWorks, we applied Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine how an object would behave when subjected to these conditions. For our final project, we designed an L-bracket fastener that was subjected to a 100 lb force, while also constrained by dimensional and fixed supports. Furthermore, a von Mises calculation was made and is as follows:

𝜎_𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤=𝜎_𝑦/(𝑆.𝐹)→     (36259.43442 𝑝𝑠𝑖)/2=       (18129.71721 𝑝𝑠𝑖)

The factor of safety was internally discussed to be 2, and the yield stress was determined using A36 steel (a material property).

The following presentation demonstrates the scope of the project and shows a sequential process of fine-tuning the design.
