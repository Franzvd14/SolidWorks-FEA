# SolidWorks-FEA
In solid mechanics, we are taught how an object undergoes external changes from forces, moments, temperature and other loads. Using the CAD software system, SolidWorks, we can applied Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine how an object will be behave when subjected to these conditions. For our final project, we designed an "L-bracket fastener" that was subjected to 100LB of force, while being subjected to dimensional and fixed support restraints. THe following presentation demostrates the scope of the project, and shows a sequencial process of "fine-tuning" the design.
