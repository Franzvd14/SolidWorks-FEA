# SolidWorks-FEA
In solid mechanics, we are taught how an object undergoes external changes from forces, moments, temperature and other loads. Using the CAD software system, SolidWorks, we can applied Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine how an object will be behave when subjected to these conditions. For our final project, we designed an "L-bracket fastener" that was subjected to 100LB of force, while being subjected to dimensional and fixed support restraints. Furthermore, a von misses calculation was made and is as follows: 

𝜎_𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤=𝜎_𝑦/(𝑆.𝐹)→     (36259.43442 𝑝𝑠𝑖)/2=       (18129.71721 𝑝𝑠𝑖)

The factor of safety was internally discusses to be 2, and the yield stress was found by using A36 Steel (a material property). 

The following presentation demostrates the scope of the project, and shows a sequencial process of "fine-tuning" the design.
